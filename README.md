# Reddit Feed Viewer

A mini-project built to access Reddit at work — because my organization blocks it 😓.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Bypasses web filters using **CORS proxy**, **Teddit**, and **Libreddit**
- 📂 Fully client-side – no installation or server required
- 📰 Browse Reddit with a cleaner, privacy-friendly interface

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-feed-viewer.git 
   ```

2. Open index.html in your browser:
- No server needed.
- Works offline once dependencies are loaded.

3. Customize your subreddit feed:
- Configure categories.js
